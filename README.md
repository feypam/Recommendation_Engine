Popularity due to a comfortable and effective online shopping experience provides companies additional data to improve their sales and costumer satisfaction. Particularly during this Covid-19 Pandemic, demand for purchasing online is on the rise.

This growing trend has also lead companies to offer customers improved solutions using machine learning and data analysis tools. One of the biggest boons come from its usage in recommendation systems. These days, as customers, windows under purchases saying 'Similar products' or 'Customers who bought this also bought these' are a familiar sight. Recommendations have become commonplace to the user experience.

In this notebook, I worked with purchasing data from one of Turkey's biggest e-trade and fashion companies, Trendyol, to demonstrate machine learning tools and algorithms behind recommendation systems.

In this notebook, the 2 most popular recommendation filtering systems were applied.

 -Content Based Filtering System
 -Collaborative Filtering System
